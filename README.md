Ths is a Car sales dataset sourced from Kaggle. In machine learning, whether we use regression or classification depends on the type of output we are predicting:

Regression is used when the target variable is continuous (e.g., predicting sales numbers, prices, or revenue).

Classification is used when the target variable is categorical (e.g., classifying car models into different popularity segments).

1) Market Analysis
Regression:

Predicting the number of cars sold in a region based on price, manufacturer, and economic factors → (Linear Regression, Random Forest Regression, XGBoost Regression)

Estimating the average price of a car based on features like model, year, mileage → (Multiple Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regression, Lasso Regression)

Classification:

Categorizing customers into different buyer personas (e.g., budget-conscious, luxury buyers) → (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, KNN, SVM)

Predicting whether a car model will be a best-seller or not based on historical data → (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost Classifier)

2) Seasonal Patterns and Competitor Analysis
Regression:

Forecasting car sales based on historical data (monthly sales trends) → (ARIMA, LSTM, Prophet, SARIMA, Time Series Regression)

Estimating how much sales will drop during off-season → (Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, XGBoost Regression)

Classification:

Identifying which season (summer, winter, festival time) sees high vs. low demand → (Decision Trees, Random Forest, SVM, Logistic Regression)

Classifying car brands based on their sales performance (e.g., "high performer," "moderate," "low performer") → (KNN, Naive Bayes, SVM, XGBoost Classifier)

3) Forecasting and Predictive Analysis
Regression:

Predicting future car sales based on past sales, marketing budget, and economic conditions → (Time Series Regression, ARIMA, Prophet, LSTMs, XGBoost Regression)

Forecasting the impact of a new car launch on overall market share → (Multiple Regression, Random Forest Regression)

Classification:

Predicting whether a given marketing campaign will result in high or low sales → (Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest Classifier)

Identifying whether a region will experience growth or decline in car sales → (Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, XGBoost Classifier)

4) Supply Chain and Inventory Optimization
Regression:

Forecasting future demand for a car model to optimize inventory levels → (Linear Regression, ARIMA, LSTM, Prophet)

Predicting the expected stock levels needed for dealerships in different regions → (Time Series Regression, XGBoost Regression)

Classification:

Categorizing dealerships based on their order frequency (e.g., "high demand," "moderate," "low demand") → (K-Means Clustering, Decision Trees, SVM, Random Forest)

Classifying suppliers based on reliability and delivery speed → (Logistic Regression, KNN, Naive Bayes, SVM)
